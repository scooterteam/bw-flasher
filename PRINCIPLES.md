# ðŸ”“ Our Principles

## You own what you buy.
If you purchased a device, you have the right to understand how it works,
repair it, and modify it. Vendors should not lock you out of hardware you own.

## Knowledge should be free.
Reverse engineering findings belong in the public domain. Hoarding this information
only empowers those selling black-market tools while honest users stay in the dark.

## Transparency over obscurity.
Weak encryption and absent authentication are security flaws, not secrets to protect.
Documenting them pushes manufacturers toward better security.

## Personal responsibility matters.
We provide tools for research and education. What you do with themâ€”and the
consequencesâ€”are yours. Know your local laws. Prioritize safety.

## No commercial exploitation.
This work is shared freely for the community, not for building products that
profit from bypassing safety features.
